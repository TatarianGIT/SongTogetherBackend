## Fixes:
 - none

## Possible future improvements:
 - add offline user list, that holds all users that logged in at least once,
 - add user roles (admin, moderator, basic), moderatos should have ability to manage queues (pause, resume, skip, remove from queue etc.), admins can promote to moderator or downgrade to basic,
