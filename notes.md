# Backend notes
## TODOS:
 - change video change logic (backend knows by itself when song ends, don't need to recieve that information from frontend),

## Fixes:
 - none

## Possible future improvements:
 - user can add song to favourites,
 - add offline user list, that holds all users that logged in at least once,
 - download two songs instead of one, so user doesn't need to wait every time when song changes,
