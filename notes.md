# Backend notes
## TODOS:
 - none

## Fixes:
 - none

## Possible future improvements:
 - user can add song to favourites,
 - add offline user list, that holds all users that logged in at least once,
 - download two songs instead of one, so user doesn't need to wait every time when song changes,
 - add user roles (admin, moderator, basic), moderatos should have ability to manage queues (pause, resume, skip, remove from queue etc.), admins can promote to moderator or downgrade to basic,
